# pomodoroTimer


The pomodoro technique is ideal for time management. How it works is you use the timer for 25 minutes to break down work into intervals, with a 5 minute break after the 25 minutes is up. Once you’ve done four intervals (or four tomatoes), it’s time for a longer break. Traditionally about 30 minutes, but that’s up to you to decide. Happy studying!
